What are Tether tokens and how do they work?

Tether tokens are assets that move across the blockchain just as easily as other digital currencies but that are pegged to real-world currencies on a 1-to-1 basis.

Tether tokens are referred to as stablecoins because they offer price stability as they are pegged to a fiat currency. This offers traders, merchants and funds a low volatility solution when exiting positions in the market.

All Tether tokens are pegged at 1-to-1 with a matching fiat currency (e.g., 1 USD₮ = 1 USD) and are backed 100% by Tether’s reserves.

As a fully transparent company, we publish a record of the current reserve assets.

How are Tether tokens Issued

More stability, more growth

Tether tokens have grown in popularity over the past few years, with a market cap of more than US$100 billion (as of March 2024). Tether tokens allow customers the ability to transact across different blockchains, without the inherent volatility and complexity typically associated with digital tokens.

Blockchain ready

Tether tokens exist as digital tokens built on various blockchains including Algorand, Avalanche, Celo, Cosmos, Ethereum, EOS, Liquid Network, Near, Polkadot, Solana, Tezos, Ton, and Tron. Therefore, issuance of Tether tokens is viable on various blockchains with varying capabilities depending on the transport protocol used.

New Tokens
Tether only issues new Tether tokens when they are requested and purchased by customers who have followed our strict KYC procedure.

Tether typically updates the information on the Tokens in Circulation page daily. The information provided is based on the information available to Tether, which may be delayed. Accordingly, the information available on the Tokens in Circulation page may not reflect the Tether Tokens in circulation at the time the information is reviewed.

The Tether Issuer is Tether International, S.A. de C.V. When "Tether Issuer" is used in connection with a particular Reserve report, it means the entity or entities identified in that report as issuing Tether Tokens pegged to fiat currencies.

'Total Assets’ represents the assets owned by the Tether Issuer (identified in the applicable Reserve report). These assets form the Reserves backing Tether Tokens as of the date of the most recent Reserves report. Tether Investments, S.A. de C.V and other entities hold corporate owned funds which are not included in the Reserves and are not a part of the "Total Assets". Tether Investments, S.A. de C.V invests in funds and other entities, some of which participate in secondary market trading in cryptocurrencies, including USD₮ and other stablecoins.

‘Total Liabilities’ represents the liabilities of the Tether Issuer (identified in the applicable Reserve report), as of the date of the most recent Reserves report.

‘Net Equity’ represents the excess of total assets to total liabilities of the Tether Issuer (identified in the applicable Reserve report), as of the date of the most recent Reserves report.

For additional details on each protocol, you can go to our FAQs page

In the table above:

The term “authorized” means tokens that have been created by Tether.

The phrase “authorized but not issued” means tokens that have been created by Tether but are not outstanding. As these tokens are not in circulation, they are not counted as part of the net circulation of the respective token.

Quarantined Tether Tokens means Tether Tokens that have been frozen at their last reported address. Tether has taken measures to prevent such Tether Tokens from being transacted by the holder of the private keys to such address. At Tether’s discretion, the quarantined Tether Tokens tokens listed are not counted as part of the net circulation of the respective Tether Token.

Supported Protocols and Integration Guidelines

We appreciate your interest in integrating TETHER tokens into your platform.

TETHER tokens exist on multiple blockchains and should be treated equally and interchangeably, i.e. 1 TETHER token on Blockchain X = 1 TETHER token on Blockchain Y.

Where possible, we request that integrators support as many of the protocols listed below as their platform currently supports/operates on and that it is made explicitly clear (both publicly and within their platform) which protocols they support.

Currently Supported Asset Protocols:

Following the news Tether Makes Strategic Transition, to Meet Community Demands and Foster Innovation on 17th August 2023, Tether discontinued support for the Kusama, Bitcoin Cash SLP and Omni Layer implementations. 

Following the news Tether Announces Strategic Transition to Prioritize Community-Driven Blockchain Support on 24th June 2024, Tether stopped minting USD₮ on EOS and Algorand

Following the news Tether Updates Users on a Strategic Transition to Better Support Community-Driven Product Support on November 27, 2024, Tether has decided to discontinue support for EUR₮. However, Tether will accept redemptions for the token until November 27, 2025.

Following the latest update, the transition process will move forward as follows:

Tether ceased minting USD₮-Omni, USD₮-Kusama, and USD₮–BCHSLP from 17th August 2023

Tether ceased minting USD₮-EOS and USD₮–Algorand from 24th June 2024.

Tether will no longer be obligated to accept redemptions of USD₮ or EUR₮ on Omni, Kusama, SLP, EOS and Algorand starting on September 1, 2025.

Users can swap USD₮ on Omni, Kusama, SLP, EOS and Algorand for other chains on platforms, such as Bitfinex, that support these assets.

Tether will freeze all remaining USD₮ and EUR₮ on Omni, Kusama, SLP, EOS and Algorand on September 1, 2025.

If you have questions about how to redeem your Tether, please contact our Customer Support team.

Omni Protocol via Bitcoin Blockchain

Important: Tether’s assets created and issued on the Omni protocol are identified by the Omni Protocol Property ID: USD₮ #31 and EUR₮ #41.

Any other TETHER property identification number is fake.

Integration for Tether (and any Omni Protocol token) is achieved through the Omni Core client. 

Omni Core is a Bitcoin core clone that supports Bitcoin and all the Omni protocol currencies. Therefore, if you are building an exchange and integrating Bitcoin/Bitcoin core, the integration path/requirements for Omni Core would be almost identical.

Being built on top of Bitcoin core, Omni Core inherits all the RPC capabilities of Bitcoin core and adds a few additional Omni Protocol Specific RPC calls of its own.

Please see the Omni Core integration guide provided by the Omni team for the technical details needed to incorporate the client into your platform:

Tether and Fuze Forge Strategic Collaboration to Elevate Digital Asset Education in Turkey and the Middle East

15 April 2024  – Tether, the largest company in the digital assets industry, and Fuze, a leading digital assets infrastructure provider with offices in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Istanbul, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish the terms of a collaboration on educational initiatives within the digital asset realm, with a particular focus on Turkey and the Middle East.

This MOU signals a pivotal moment in the advancement of digital asset awareness and understanding across the region. Through these cooperation efforts, Tether and Fuze aim to address various facets of education around digital asset space, encompassing cross-border payment solutions, compliance, regulatory framework development, and education for local financial institutions.

In pursuit of these objectives, this collaboration will see the two companies undertaking a range of collaborative endeavors which include educational campaigns to promote the adoption of digital assets such as Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) to facilitate cross-border payments. These initiatives will be strategically designed to highlight the efficiency and accessibility benefits of using digital assets in a compliant manner for businesses and individuals across Turkey, the Middle East, and North Africa.

Tether and Fuze will also analyze the development of programs and workshops aimed at enhancing awareness and understanding of digital assets and blockchain technology among local financial institutions and individuals in the aforementioned regions. These efforts will align with evolving regulatory requirements and standards to ensure compliance in the dynamic regulatory landscape. Joint strategies will be designed to promote educational initiatives and workshops, demonstrating a commitment to ethical and responsible educational practices.

Additionally, these strategies will prioritize educating merchants and businesses on the practical utility of digital assets like Bitcoin and Tether for everyday transactions, aiming to increase awareness and adoption of digital assets. The initiatives will also include the engagement of local and regional banks and financial institutions to educate them on the benefits of utilizing stablecoins and digital assets for their customers, empowering financial institutions with the knowledge and tools necessary to leverage digital assets effectively.

"As we team up with Fuze, we're thrilled to be part of a movement that brings digital assets within reach of people across Turkey, the Middle East, and North Africa,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether.  “Our collaboration isn't just about technology; it's about empowering individuals, businesses, and financial institutions to navigate the evolving landscape of finance with confidence and clarity." 

Commenting further on the collaboration, Mo Ali Yusuf, Co-Founder and CEO of Fuze said, “We’re proud to team up with the Tether team who share our vision that digital assets will power the future of finance. By educating stakeholders at all levels, we can accelerate the digital assets landscape and ensure that everyone from institutions to end consumers benefit from the vast opportunities presented by well-managed, secure, and trusted digital assets.”

Tether and Coins.ph Collaborate on Blockchain Education Initiative in the Philippines

10 April, 2024 —   Tether Operations Limited (Tether), the largest company in the digital asset industry, and Coins.ph, a leading digital asset exchange in the Philippines, announced today that they are joining forces to promote financial education of blockchain technologies, Bitcoin, and Stablecoins, in the region. 

This collaboration will empower Filipinos with financial knowledge through a series of educational programs developed by Coins.ph, tailored to diverse audiences. This will include workshops, online campaigns, and interactive quizzes designed to increase awareness and understanding of digital assets and their potential benefits.

“The Philippines is a nation brimming with potential for digital asset adoption”, said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. "Through this collaboration with Coins.ph, we hope to equip Filipinos with the knowledge and tools to navigate the exciting world of blockchain technologies. Tether is proud to spearhead a movement that combines cutting-edge technology, education, and financial inclusion."

“Our collaboration with Tether marks a significant step towards equipping Filipinos with essential knowledge to participate in the growing digital asset economy. A key focus of this will be the use of Stablecoins such as USDT for cross-border payments and remittances,” said Wei Zhou, CEO  of Coins.ph. “This collaboration aligns with our mission to make financial services accessible and inclusive for everyone in the Philippines.”

This latest collaboration is a further demonstration of Tether's overarching mission to facilitate easy access to educational resources that promote an understanding and responsible utilization of blockchain-backed digital assets. This endeavor represents an extension of Tether's existing groundwork in Thailand, Georgia, Uzbekistan, and Africa where Tether has collaborated on educational initiatives to raise awareness and understanding of blockchain technology and stablecoins. With these initiatives, Tether seeks to equip citizens with the necessary knowledge and proficiency to thrive in the cryptocurrency sphere, encompassing vital areas like avant-garde technology, stablecoins, and peer-to-peer systems.

The educational initiatives will target diverse segments of the Filipino population, including finance professionals like bankers and fintech companies, but also Overseas Filipino Workers seeking efficient remittance solutions, pawnshop owners and customers, and individuals curious about the fundamentals of cryptocurrency.

About Tether

Tether was founded by a group of Bitcoin enthusiasts and early adopters, passionate about facilitating the use of fiat currencies in a digital manner. In 2014, the company launched Tether.to, a blockchain-enabled platform aimed at disrupting the conventional financial system with a more modern approach to money.

A visionary approach and a pioneering spirit

As the first blockchain-enabled platform to facilitate the digital use of traditional currencies—a familiar, stable accounting unit—Tether has created a revolutionary building block that companies worldwide can use to offer democratised cross-border financial services.

With Tether tokens, customers can confidently transact with traditional currencies using blockchains as transport layers, without the volatility and complexity typically associated with a digital currency.

A growing team around the world

Tether is led and managed by a senior management team with extensive experience in financial services, technology, and compliance. Drawing on the expertise of a diverse and dynamic team spread across the globe, Tether tokens have grown from being the first to the largest stablecoin by volume today.

When we say that we think we can process your data, it is because we considered we have a legitimate interest (for ourselves or of a third party) to do so; it is in the interest of our organization to conduct and manage our business; this includes conducting analytics to improve and optimize the Site and the Services, protecting our interests and enforcing agreements with others, as well as complying with industry self-regulatory requirements.  We might have a legitimate interest to process Personal Information in other contexts. We ensure we balance any potential impact on you and your rights before we process your Personal Information on that basis. You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us. Please also consult the section “Your rights” below.

It is important that the Personal Information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your Personal Information changes during your relationship with us. You can do so by lodging a customer support ticket. We will endeavor to effect those changes within a reasonable timeframe.

We do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your Personal Information other than in relation to our use of cookies (please refer to our Cookies Notice), and when we send third party direct marketing communications to you via email. From time to time, we may share your Personal Information with third parties with your consent.

Aggregated Data. We may also aggregate personal and other data captured by us so that the data is no longer capable of identifying an individual. Aggregated data may cover patterns of usage or information and data that you provide to us, and we reserve the right to use this aggregated information for the purposes of improving and enhancing our Services, generating insights, for use in marketing to other users and current and potential partners and otherwise for the purposes of our business. Provided that such aggregated data does not directly or indirectly identify you as an individual, this data is not considered to be Personal Information and is not covered by this Privacy Statement.

2. Security and Confidentiality.

Tether is committed to protecting your privacy. Internally, only people with a business need to know Personal Information, or whose duties reasonably require access to it, are granted access to customers’ Personal Information. Such individuals will only process your Personal Information on our instructions and are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We audit our personal compliance regularly.

The Site’s systems and data are reviewed periodically to ensure that you are getting a quality service and that leading security features are in place. We have put in place procedures to deal with any actual or suspected data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

Tether takes all reasonable endeavors to protect and safeguard Personal Information. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. While we do our utmost to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to us over email or through the Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your Personal Information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access, but there are protective measures you should take, as well.  Do not share your Personal Information with others unless you clearly understand the purpose of their request for it and you know with whom you are dealing. Do not keep sensitive Personal Information in your e-mail inbox or on Webmail. If you are asked to assign passwords to connect you to your Personal Information, you should use a secure password and always use two-factor authentication (2FA), where available. You should change your password regularly.

3. What and with whom we share your Personal Information

As necessary, we will share your Personal Information with:

a) Any member of our group, which means our direct or indirect subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and any other subsidiary of that holding company, including their respective shareholders, directors, officers, affiliates, employees, contractors, agents, partners, insurers, and attorneys or representatives.

b) Our service providers, to the extent necessary to supply the Services to you

c) Selected third parties, including analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimization of the Services.

d) Authorities and law enforcement agencies worldwide either when ordered to do so or on a voluntary basis if this appears reasonable and necessary to us (please refer to our Law Enforcement Requests Policy available).

We also disclose your Personal Information to third parties:

a) If Tether or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case Personal Information held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.

b) If we are under a duty to disclose or share your Personal Information in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our clients, or others, including to defend ourselves from legal claims.

You can find more information on the actual parties we are sharing your data with here. The list is updated regularly.

Tether reserves the right to share current and historical bids, asks, and market prices; opening and closing range prices; high–low prices; trade prices; estimated and actual trade volumes; settlement prices; and other aggregate data and information related to the digital tokens purchased or redeemed on the Site.

4. Transfers

Your Personal Information will be stored in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and may be transferred worldwide.

Personal Information and other data may therefore be exported outside of the jurisdiction in which you reside. Your Personal Information may be processed and stored in a foreign country or countries. Under those circumstances, the governments, courts, law enforcement, or regulatory agencies of that country or those countries may be able to obtain access to your Personal Information through foreign laws. You need to be aware that the privacy standards of those countries may be lower than those of the jurisdiction in which you reside.

EEA customers. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Statement. All data you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Where we transfer our data outside of the EEA, we ensure that adequate safeguards are in place. That includes, where necessary, taking steps to evaluate the risks raised by the transfers in countries that do not offer an adequate level of protection. Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Information out of the EEA.

5. Data Retention

We have data retention and deletion policies designed to retain Personal Information for no longer than necessary for the purposes set out herein or as otherwise required to meet legal or business needs. Because of those retention requirements, we might not be able to honor erasure requests.

6. Your rights

All Customers. You may access and verify your Personal Information held by Tether, where consent is the legal basis for processing of your Personal Information and subject to any legal or contractual restrictions, withdraw your consent, in each case, by submitting a written request to privacy@tether.to. Our electronic marketing communications also contain opt-out mechanism and options to update your contact information or change your preferences at any time. We will do our best to honor your request promptly. For cookies, this is done by setting up the cookies’ preferences.

EEA Customers. You have a number of rights in relation to how we process your Personal Information. You may exercise these rights by contacting us (see details below). These include the right to:

a) access the Personal Information that we may hold about you;

b) rectify any inaccurate Personal Information that we may hold about you;

c) have your Personal Information erased in certain circumstances, for example, where it is no longer necessary for us to process your Personal Information to fulfill our processing purposes; or where you have exercised your right to object to the processing;

d) restrict the processing of your Personal Information where, for example, the information is inaccurate or it is no longer necessary for us to process such information or where you have exercised your right to object to our processing;

e) object to the processing of your Personal Information which may be exercised in certain circumstances, for example, where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, or where your own legitimate interests outweigh ours;

f) have your Personal Information ported to a new service provider if you no longer wish to use the Services. You may exercise these rights by contacting us (see details below); and

g) when we rely on your consent to process Personal Information (cookies and newsletter communication), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. For cookies, this is done by setting up the cookie’s preferences. Please visit our Cookies Notice. For newsletters, you can do so by opting-out using the link provided in the newsletters at any time or by submitting a written request to privacy@tether.to. We will do our best to honor your request promptly.

No fee usually required.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information or to exercise any of your other rights. We may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

What we may need from you.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

Time limit to respond.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

7. Changes to this Privacy Statement

Any changes we make to our Privacy Statement in the future will be posted on this page and, where material, notified to you by e-mail. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Statement.
